# [Input Handle](https://github.com/kultie/UnityGames/blob/master/InputHandle.cs)

Don't know why i made this but i think it's neat for top down old style rpg movement set. Feel free to use it.

## How to use
- Call InputHandle.UpdateInput() in your script's update method
- Call InputHandle.GetLastInput() to get the last direction key you press use the result for your need
- Sorry for the string use because i'm lazy af
